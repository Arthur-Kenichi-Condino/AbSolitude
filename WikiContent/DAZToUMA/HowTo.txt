1.open DAZ Studio
1.a.add a Genesis morph body to the Scene
1.b.(optional)add underwear
1.c.export as FBX 2012 -- Binary:
--Deselect all settings
--Select the following:
---Selected(Selected Only), with the morph body selected only
---Figures(Include Figures)
---Props(Include Props)
---Morphs(Include Morphs) with the following export rules:
----FBM-Export
----PBM-Export
----PHM-Export
----eCTRL-Export
----pCTRL-Export
----SCL-Export
----CTRLBodybuilder-Export
----pJCM-Export
---Embed Textures(Embed Textures [Binary Only])
---Collect Textures To Folder(Collect Textures)
---Merge Clothing Into Figure Skeleton(Merge Followers [into Target])
---Allow Degraded Skinning
---Allow Degraded Scaling
---Collapse UV Tiles
--...there are 10 settings in total to be selected.

2.open Blender3D
--Note: H hides vertices, Alt+H unhides all, A selects all vertices, Alt+A deselects everything
2.a.select File->Import->FBX
2.b.[[Deselect]] the following settings:
--Transform: Use Pre/Post Rotation
2.c.[[Select]] the following settings:
--Armature: Force Connect Children
--Armature: Automatic Bone Orientation
2.d.(optional)save settings as an import preset
2.e.enter Edit Mode and reduce the size of the facial bones without moving them(so we can see the character's face): select the endings and move them towards the start
2.f.change to Object Mode and select the 3D model body
2.g.select the Material tab
2.h.now, we will [[Assign]] materials which are the ''same'' (they have the same texture mapped to them) to only one of the materials in the list:
--For example:
---Enter Edit Mode and deselect everything in the current View
---Select Face and press the Select button in the Material tab
---Do the same for Lips, Ears and EyeSocket
---Select Face again and press the Assign button
---Go to Object Mode again and remove with the Minus button the Materials which were assigned to Face (Lips, Ears and EyeSocket [but [[not]] Face])
---Repeat these steps for each material in the list which ''repeats'' itself
--Change Cornea material to Blend Mode: Alpha Blend and Shadow Mode: None then set its alpha to 0

3.clear the morphs list in Blender for every mesh (in Data tab->Shape Keys in Object Mode), so only the used ones are remaining

4.splitting the model in Blender for each material
4.a.go to Object mode
--Note: Shift+D duplicates the selected object
4.b.create ''splits'' of the model for each material, following these next steps:
--duplicate the ''unified'' model(all model whole body vertices)
--hide(using the Eye Icon) the ''unified'' model so it's safe from changes
--rename the duplicate to TEMP, as it's used for separations
--go to Edit Mode
--select the material (Face) in the Material tab list and press the Select button
--Mesh->Separate the mesh by Selection(or use P->Selection)
--rename the duplicate(separation just created) to the same name of the material, for example: Face
--repeat the process for each material in the Material tab list
--Delete the TEMP duplicate, which is empty now
--unhide(using the Eye Icon) everything
--go through every separation created and remove all materials except the material which is used for the Separation selection (in Object Mode)
4.c.do the step 4.b for each ''unified'' mesh in the Blender Collection/Scene which has more than one material, for example: Eyelashes

5.prepare for exporting to Unity
5.a.in Object mode, select the entire Rig/Model(everything in the hierarchy which is part of the 3D model, not just the ''root'':the ''parent'' and all ''children'':every item)
5.b.do Object->Aplly(or use Ctrl+A) and apply Rotation & Scale to everything
5.c.add Global and Position bones to the Skeleton by doing the following:
--open the Skeleton/Rig in the hierarchy and select the first bone, for example: hip
--enter Edit Mode
--add 2 Single Bones
--call the first Single Bone ''Global'' and set its Bone tab Transform as:
---Head:
----X:0,
----Y:-0.01,
----Z:0
---Tail:
----X:0,
----Y:0,
----Z:0
--and the second Single Bone, ''Position'', set it as the exact opposite:
---Head:
----X:0,
----Y:0,
----Z:0
---Tail:
----X:0,
----Y:-0.01,
----Z:0
5.d.set the parent of the first bone in the Rig, for example, hip, as Position:
--select hip and Position and then do Armature->Parent->Make (or use Ctrl+P) and choose Keep Offset
--repeat the process, but now set Position parent as Global
--now you have the hierarchy Global.Position.hip

5.export to Unity
5.a.do File->Export->FBX and set the following export settings
--first remove everything in Object Types except Armature and Mesh to be exported
--Armature: deselect Add Leaf Bones
5.b.(optional)save settings as an export preset

6.import into Unity
6.a.put the FBX file into the Unity project folder
6.b.
